A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/jak_e/pen/qNqaMQ](https://codepen.io/jak_e/pen/qNqaMQ).

generating abstract stuffs with perlin noise. perlin noise is great because it is procedurally generative. that means this will look the same every time unless you change the seed on line 1. 

color blending gets a little nutty and creates the weird squares. that is not the product of perlin.
