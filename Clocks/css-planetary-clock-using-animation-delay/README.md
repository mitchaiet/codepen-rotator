# CSS Planetary Clock using animation-delay

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/z-/pen/regJjN](https://codepen.io/z-/pen/regJjN).

I am a fan of negative `animation-delay`s and I don't believe I've seen it in a clock - and I was watching 2001: A Space Odyssey again (after seeing  Chris Gannon's [pen of the same theme](http://s.codepen.io/chrisgannon/debug/zqQOrv)) so I thought it might look cool to have orbiting bodies to mark out the hour, minute and seconds.  
  
All animations are CSS and I used jQuery to populate dots (haven't looked into HTML pre-processors yet) and set the animation delay.

To do: add eclipses.
