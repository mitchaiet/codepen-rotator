# Pure CSS morphing polyhedra: dodecahedron → rhombicosidodecahedron → snub dodecahedron  → rhombicosidodecahedron → icosahedron

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/gOjGyby](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/gOjGyby).

###What's happening

Regular dodecahedron faces move outwards making the 3D shape expand into a [rhombicosidodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombicosidodecahedron) with triangles growing at the corners (connecting the formerly common vertices of the 3 pentagonal faces meeting at a cube corner) and rectangles (while animating)/ squares (for the final rhombicosidodecahedron) at the edges.

Next, the initial dodecahedron faces and the triangles that have grown at the corners twist a little in opposite directions (and also go inward a tiny little bit), while the squares that have grown at the edges split into halves and these right triangle halves turn into equilateral triangles in keeping up with the twist of the other faces. A [snub dodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snub_dodecahedron) is thus formed.

Btw, this is not my first time coding a snub dodecaheron - I first CSS-ed one exactly [9 years earlier](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/AgyBNK).

We then go back to a rhombicosidodecahedron, then twist the initial dodecahedron faces and the triangles that have grown at the corners in the opposite direction, so we get the other possible snub dodecahedron. 

Finally, we go back to a rhombicosidodecahedron, which we then collapse to an icosahedron by shrinking the squares in between the edges and the pentagons at the vertices of the blue triangles.

###How was this made

Pure CSS and very little of it for that matter - the magic of CSS variables!
